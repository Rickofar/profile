 My Personalized Resume

This personalized resume contains my career progression in web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have been able to master HTML and CSS to a considerable level of proficiency. However, as the time of publishing this website (August 18, 2022), I am still trying to figure out how to navigate Javascript.

However, the success I have achieved so far, is from how I was able to employ Bootstrap and Media Query to achieve a responsive web design.

I am using this README.md to document my daily challenges and successes as I progress in this new found path.
